Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. Programming language is simply a set of instructions that can be used to manipulate data in the computer.
It is used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK is used for developing Java applications and applets.It includes: an interpreter/loader (java),
a compiler (javac) is used to compile Java source code files into executable Java bytecode classes,
debugger is used to debug a code. Disassembler to disassembles class files.
An archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

What is IDE?
A. IDE is stands for Integrated Development Environment. An IDE typically contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter,
and a debugger, accessed through a single graphical user interface (GUI). The user writes and edits source code in the code editor.
The compiler translates the source code into a readable language that is executable for a computer. And the debugger tests the software
to solve any issues or bugs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, Intellij, NetBeans, JGrasp and so on.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. A Java program is written using either a Text Editor like Textpad or an IDE like Eclipse and is saved as a .java file. (Program.java)
   The .java file is then compiled using Java compiler and a .class file is obtained from it. (Program.class)
   The .class file is now portable and can be used to run this Java program in any platform.
   Class file (Program.class) is interpreted by the JVM installed on a particular platform. JVM is part of the JRE software.

What is class?
A. Class is a blue print or template for objects.

What is object?
A. Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. In computer programming, an entry point is where the first instructions in a program are executed, and where the program has access
to command line arguments. To start a program's execution, the loader or operating system passes control to its entry point.
For example: in Java 'main' method is the entry point of the application.

Why main is static?
A. In order to invoke the JVM without creating a new object of a class, we need to have a “main” method as static.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. The Object class, which is stored in the java.lang package, is the ultimate superclass of all Java classes (except for Object ).

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. -Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.ie in J2EE we give the path of jar files.
-PATH is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system. Operating System will look in this PATH for executables.
Classpath is nothing but setting up the environment for Java. Java will use to find compiled classes.
-Path refers to the system while classpath refers to the Developing Environment.
-In path we set the path of executables while in classpath we set path of jars for compiling classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface can only have abstract method but Abstract class can be both abstract and non abstract method.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? if not how do you use it?
A. No. We can implements Interface or extends a Abstract class.

what is Access Specifier?
A. Java Access Specifiers (also known as Visibility Specifiers) regulate access to classes, fields and methods in Java.
These Specifiers determine whether a field or method in a class, can be used or invoked by another method in another class or sub-class.
Access Specifiers can be used to restrict access.

What is OOP? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.
Features: Abstraction(implementation hiding), Inheritance(is used for extending classes), Encapsulation(Data hiding),
and Polymorphism(Ability of an object to take many form).

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. Java package contains API in the java API library. Default package: java.lang.object;

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of pre-written codes found in JDK to make our code writing experience easier.
Some of the most common API I have used:
  java.util.*;
  java.lang.object;
  java.lang.Math;

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. No, to avoid ambiguity error java does not support multiple inheritance through class.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but with different arguments.
Method overloading happens in compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts
the normal flow of the program’s instructions. Exception indicates conditions that a reasonable application might try to catch.
Java exception handling is managed via five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods?
A. The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.

What is a constructor ?
A. It is a Block of codes just like a method but without a return type. Can be called when you creating an object.
The purpose of constructor is to initialize an object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes, we can have multiple constructors in a class.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. Default Constructor will be called.
